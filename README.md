PSJS ("Piece of Sh*t Javascript" or "Please stop... just stop" or whatever else you think it stands for that denegrates javascript)

allows you to stop javascript at different urls at different levels

KEEP IN MIND, THIS WILL BREAK SITES. THIS IS MEANT TO BREAK SITES. MOST SITES THAT YOU'D WANT TO USE THIS ON WILL PROBABLY USE, AND RELY ON, TOO MUCH JAVASCRIPT. THIS ALLOWS YOU TO STOP THAT TO THE DETRIMENT OF THE SITE.
